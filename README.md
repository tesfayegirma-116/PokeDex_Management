## Create

A feature to add a new Pokémon to a favorites list. Users should be able to search for a Pokémon by name and favorite it by clicking a star button. Once favorited, it should appear in their favorites list on the dashboard.

## Read

Retrieve a list of all Pokémon from the PokéAPI and display them on your dashboard. Each Pokémon should at least display its name and image, and be shown in a list or grid format. Each Pokémon in the list should have a star button that can be toggled to favorite or unfavorite it.

## Update

Implement a feature that allows renaming a Pokémon in the favorites list. This could be done in a modal, a separate page, or inline in the list, at your discretion. Once changes are saved, the Pokémon in the favorites list should be updated without needing to manually refresh the page.

## Delete

A button or icon that removes a Pokémon from the favorites list. Upon clicking this button, the Pokémon should be removed from the favorites list without requiring a page refresh.
